Taylor Swift,i walked through the door with you the air was cold but something 'bout it felt like home somehow and i left my scarf there at your sister's house and you've still got it in your drawer even now oh your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze we're singing in the car getting lost upstate autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place and i can picture it after all these days and i know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more and i might be okay but i'm not fine at all oh oh oh 'cause there we are again on that little town street you almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me wind in my hair i was there i remember it all too well photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed and your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team you taught me 'bout your past thinking your future was me and you were tossing me the car keys "fuck the patriarchy" key chain on the ground we were always skipping town and i was thinking on the drive down any time now he's gonna say it's love you never called it what it was 'til we were dead and gone and buried check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same after three months in the grave and then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you but all i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame and i know it's long gone and there was nothing else i could do and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to 'cause there we are again in the middle of the night we're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light down the stairs i was there i remember it all too well and there we are again when nobody had to know you kept me like a secret but i kept you like an oath sacred prayer and we'd swear to remember it all too well yea well maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up running scared i was there i remember it all too well and you call me up again just to break me like a promise so casually cruel in the name of being honest i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here 'cause i remember it all all all they say all's well that ends well but i'm in a new hell every time you double-cross my mind you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine and that made me want to die the idea you had of me who was she? a never-needy ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you not weeping in a party bathroom some actress asking me what happened you that's what happened you you who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show but then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come and he said "it's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one" time won't fly it's like i'm paralyzed by it i'd like to be my old self again but i'm still trying to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now you mail back my things and i walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from that very first week 'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me you can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well yeah 'cause there we are again when i loved you so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known it was rare i was therei remember it all too well wind in my hair you were there you remember it all down the stairs you were there you remember it all it was rare i was there i remember it all too well and i was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes "i'll get older but your lovers stay my age" from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones i'm a soldier who's returning half her weight and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue? just between us did the love affair maim you too?

Ed Sheeran,i met this girl late last year she said "don't you worry if i disappear" i told her "i'm not really looking for another mistake" i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait but then i jumped right in a week later returned i reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn but i gave her my time for two or three nights then i put it on pause until the moment was right i went away for months until our paths crossed again she told me "i was never looking for a friend maybe you could swing by my room around ten baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin we'll be in between the sheets 'til the late am" baby if you wanted me then should have just said she's singing don't fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i don't wanna know that babe don't fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i don't wanna know that babe and for a couple weeks i only wanna see her we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza before a text message was the only way to reach her now she's staying at my place and loves the way i treat her singing out aretha all over the track like a feature and never wants to sleep i guess that i don't want to either but me and her we make money the same way four cities two planes the same day and those shows have never been what it's about but maybe we'll go together and just figure it out i'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch but we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now wish i'd have written it down the way that things played out when she was kissing him how i was confused about now she should figure it out while i'm sat here singing don't fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i don't wanna know that babe don't fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i don't wanna know that babe on my hotel door i don't even know if she knows what for she was crying on my shoulder i already told ya trust and respect is what we do this for i never intended to be next (you bastard) but you didn't need to take him to bed that's all and i never saw him as a threat (you bastard) until you disappeared with him to have sex of course it's not like we were both on tour we were staying on the same fucking hotel floor and i wasn't looking for a promise or commitment but it was never just fun and i thought you were different this is not the way you realized what you wanted it's a bit too much too late if i'm honest and all this time god knows i'm singing don't fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i don't wanna know that babe don't fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i don't wanna know that babe don't fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i don't wanna know that babe don't fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i don't wanna know that babe
